INPUT for 150K USD seed funds requested to the OWASP board (for meeting 30 nov 2016)

Here is more input for our request to have 150K USD set aside for the upcoming owasp-devseccon-summit next year in the UK.

Our draft budget is available here:
https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-devseccon-summit/blob/master/Budget/owasp-devseccon-summit-budget.xlsx
We will further refine and improve this together with Laura and Andrew in the coming days.

We already submitted the summit in OCMS.

Next week we will have the summit week decided (probably in June 2017) and we are currently visiting and talking with multiple venues. 

As soon as we have the final timing we will contract the venue together with Laura, Matt and Andrew.

Let's be clear: we do not ask for 150 as a sunk cost or as a blank cheque.
We will tap into several sources of income to organize this summit:
1) people coming to the summit will be asked to cover their own travel/accommodation. We will only sponsor invited people that do not have support from their own organisation.
2) we will ask the participating projects for seed funds: e.g. SAMM already donated 10.000 USD 
3) we will ask chapters to sponsor the summit with the budget they have available (potentially 750K+ USD)
4) we will create sponsor packages for our regular OWASP sponsors to support this summit

We do not expect that we will be making a profit, and that is not our goal. 
But we will definitely want to break-even with the above sources of income (like we already did with the SAMM summits in previous years).
We see the 150K seed fund as our "starting capital" to assure that we can book the venue and start the logistics.
And, of course, we will involve you and the staff on any major steps that would impact the financial bottom-line.

What do we get out of this, or what is our "ROI"?
It all starts with getting the right people together working on the right content. 
So our main goal is to organize workshops, sessions & sprints at the summit driven by both DevOps and AppSec people & principles.
The first list and (active) collaboration is already starting here:
https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-devseccon-summit/tree/master/Workshops.

Our objective is to make a big impact and productivity boost on our projects and community by getting the main DevOps and AppSec people in one venue for 5 days 24/7 in "summit-mode". We are getting very positive feedback and people that indicated that they will come (see the Doodle here http://doodle.com/poll/e8d4p955rc8guuru).

The Summit success will be measured by the impact we will make with our summit deliverables and the impact on OWASP projects & the community.

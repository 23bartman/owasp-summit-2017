The OWASP Summit team is committed to bringing as many OWASP Leaders (and other contributors) to the Summit. 

&nbsp;
Most summit attendes are able to use their companies funds to cover the Summit expenses (ticket, travel and time). For the cases where that is not poassble (maybe because the company is not able to cover the expenses, the participant is an independently contractor or works for a start-up), there are a number of scenarious where the OWASP Foundation and the Summit team will be able to cover the ticket and travel costs.

&nbsp;
Here are the current options:

&nbsp;
1. An OWASP Chapter or Project that has funds sponsors an participant (here is the list of the [funds avaialble to chapters and projects](https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/spreadsheets/d/11acTOmtmBGq6-5CIGsjlEByU8POSGqda0r23VNnhEGQ/pub?hl=en_US&hl=en_US&output=html))
2. Apply to OWASP Foundation for a sponsorship to participate in this event [using this form](https://www.tfaforms.com/308703)

If you are interested, the first step is to make sure you are part of the [Participants need support](Participants-need-support.html) list

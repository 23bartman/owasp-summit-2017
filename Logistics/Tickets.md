## Tickets

There are two types of tickets for this Summit both covering participation in the summit for the full 5 days.

- 5 days x 24h participant (venue, lunch, dinner, accommodation): 
    - £1,200 GBP
    - €1,400 Euro 
    - $1,500 USD
- 5 days x 8h participant (venue, lunch) - 
    - £400 GBP 
    - €465 Euro 
    - $500 USD

As with the previous Summits the accommodation is based on villas (called lodges at Woburn); these are a key part of making the event an 'OWASP Summit'.

The layout of the CenterParcs Woburn villas/lodges is actually better than the previous summits, and we are expecting a lot of high productive and energetic sessions to occur :)

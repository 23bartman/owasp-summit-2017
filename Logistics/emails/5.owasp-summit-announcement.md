### OWASP Summit 2017 Announcement

It's now official, the next OWASP Summit will happen in London/England between 12 and 16 of June 2017 (date chosen using an doodle with 73 participants).

This event will be hosted at the CenterParcs Woburn venue which we have already booked the first set of 10 villas and meeting rooms.

Using the same model from 2008 and 2011 previous Summits (in Portugal), this will be a working summit with 18h a day working sessions and collaboration.

The Summit will focus on the collaboration between Developers and Application Security, with an emphasis on OWASP Projects.

These Summits are about its participants and Working sessions. After all the Summit organisation is just setting an hyper productive and collaboration environment, its up to the attendees (i.e. you) to figure our what is the best use of your time and what to focus on.

Here is how I like to think about the Summit: "If you could get the best minds of XYZ in the same room for a number of hours/days, what should they work on?" (see more details below on the _'Why OWASP needs Summits'_ text)



There are already a number of Work Sessions are Tracks being worked on (OwaspSAMM, ZAP, WebGoat, Top 10, Mobile Security, AWS Security, Threat Modeling) and we really need your help in improving their



**Why OWASP needs Summits**

We need these summits because we need as a community and industry a place where we can come together and work on ideas and on solutions.

We need places where we can have independent non-vendor focus discussions about hard problems that we have.

OWASP is one of the few organizations in the world that is able to achieve that.

The problem we have with conferences is that they are very uni-directional, they are people presenting their research and in fact there is some interesting comment about the current lack of innovation on conferences where we basically keep going around and around with the same kind of topics and ideas.

So, the best part of conferences is the lobby part, is the people that we meet and we talk there.

The problem is that those conversations are very ad hoc, they aren't planned, there is no work before, there is no preparation for those conversations.

The summit allows you to have that, the summit allows you in a way to be prepared for those exchanges where you know you are going to meet people that are interested about this topic, where you know there is going to be a critical mass of knowledge about a specific topic that we/you want to talk about.

And that is the power of the summit, is the fact that the people that matter and care about a particular topic are there. More importantly they are there to work, they are there focused in workment and that is what makes the summits so special is these places where we can come and create amazing and important deliverables.

What are those deliverables? I don't know, it depends on the participants, it depends on the people, in a way it depends on who is going to go there and how much they believed on it, and how much effort they put into it.

All that we can do for an OWASP and as a community is to set the stage, it is up to the participants to actually create magic and to create something quite amazing.

_Are you tired of going to conferences where the best part are the conversations and 'work' that happen during the conference hall and hotel? If so, OWASP Summit's are the place to go_

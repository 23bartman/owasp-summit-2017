### OWASP Summit 2017 Announcement

(to send to owasp leaders)

**OWASP Summit 2017 - Please join us**

It's now official, the next OWASP Summit will happen in London/England between 12 and 16 of June 2017 (date chosen using an doodle with 73 participants).

This event will be hosted at the CenterParcs Woburn venue and we have already booked the first block of 10 villas and meeting rooms.

Using the same model from 2008 and 2011 previous Summits (in Portugal), this will be a working summit with 18h a day working sessions and collaboration.

In order to clarify the model of the Summit, we decided to rename it to just 'OWASP Summit 2017', and give it a focus on the collaboration between: OWASP Projects, Developers, Application Security and DevOps.


**Working Sessions**

Summits are about its participants and Working sessions, there are no presentations and all sessions are about getting something done.

The Summit organisation objective is to set-up an hyper productive and collaboration environment, its up to the attendees (i.e. you) to figure our what is the best use of your time and what to focus on.

As you can see at https://owasp.github.io/owasp-summit-2017/workshops.html, there are already a number of Working Sessions and Tracks being worked on (OwaspSAMM, ZAP, WebGoat, Top 10, Mobile Security, AWS Security, Threat Modeling) but we need a lot more.

This content is managed using GitHub (https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-summit-2017/tree/master/Workshops), please help to improve the existing Working Session and create the pages with the missing ones.

Here is how I like to think about the Summit: _**"If you could get the best minds of XYZ in the same room for a number of hours/days, what should they work on?"**_ (see more details below on the _'Why OWASP needs Summits'_)

If you can't make it to the venue of those dates, please also be involved in the setup and content of these working sessions, since there will be multiple ways to participate remotely and collaborate.

**Tickets**

There are two types of tickets for this Summit both covering participation in the summit for the full 5 days.

- **5 days 24h participant** (venue, lunch, dinner, accommodation): £1,200 GBP (about $1,500 USD)
- **5days 8h participant** (venue, lunch) - £400 GBP (about $500 USD)

As with the previous Summits the accommodation is based on villas (called lodges at Woburn) and are a key part of making the Summit an 'OWASP Summit'.

The layout of the CenterParcs Woburn  villas/lodges is actually better than the previous summits, and I'm expecting a lot of high productive and energetic sessions to occur :)

The tickets will be soon available for sale and if your OWASP Chapter or Project has funds that it would like to use for the Summit, please do that as soon as possible.

Ideally your company will be able to support your participation in this event. If that is not possible (or your are in independent contractor) then please let the Summit know about it since their will be some funds available to help out (specially if you are Owasp Leader with a successful track record on an OWASP Project, Chapter or Conference )

There will also be a number of sponsorship opportunities avaiable for Companies and OWASP Chapters/Projects (at the moment we have DevSecCon, OwaspSAMM project and OWASP London Chapter)

**Why OWASP needs Summits**

We need these summits because we need as a community and industry a place where we can come together and work on ideas and on solutions.

We need places where we can have independent non-vendor focus discussions about hard problems that we have.

OWASP is one of the few organisations in the world that is able to achieve that.

The problem we have with conferences is that they are very uni-directional, they are people presenting their research and in fact there is some interesting comment about the current lack of innovation on conferences where we basically keep going around and around with the same kind of topics and ideas.

So, the best part of conferences is the lobby part, is the people that we meet and we talk there.

The problem is that those conversations are very ad hoc, they aren't planned, there is no work before, there is no preparation for those conversations.

The summit allows you to have that, the summit allows you in a way to be prepared for those exchanges where you know you are going to meet people that are interested about this topic, where you know there is going to be a critical mass of knowledge about a specific topic that we/you want to talk about.

And that is the power of the summit, is the fact that the people that matter and care about a particular topic are there. More importantly they are there to work, they are there focused in work and that is what makes the summits so special is these places where we can come and create amazing and important deliverables.

What are those deliverables? I don't know, it depends on the participants, it depends on the people, in a way it depends on who is going to go there and how much they believed on it, and how much effort they put into it.

All that we can do for an OWASP and as a community is to set the stage, it is up to the participants to actually create magic and to create something quite amazing.


**Please help, by booking your place asap**

It will really help with the logistics and management of the Summit if we have a good idea of the participants, what type of ticket they need (with accommodation or not) and if they are able to get their current company to cover the participation cost.

Let us know how we can help, and thanks for the help

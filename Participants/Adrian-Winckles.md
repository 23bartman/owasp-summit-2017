##Adrian Winckles

I’ve approached my employer who can give me the time to attend but isn’t going to be able to cover the accomodation cost but will cover travel. 

This is due to funding for me to go to AppSec Europe 2017 in Belfast in May with a team for the University Challenge

What I would also like to propose is two ideas for Workshops/Themes

    Software Defined Everything (SDx) (which I’ve been having discussions with Frank Catucci, Azeddine Mennouchi & Bev Corwin to raise this at AppSec this year
    Application Security BSc/Masters Curriculum Design - initial discussions with Andrew van der Stock & Tiffany so I see the summit as an opportunity to get this started.

[Sven Schleier](./Sven-Schleier.html) and I would like to do a [Mobile Security workshop](../Working-Sessions/Mobile-Security.html) around the OWASP Mobile Testing Guide Standard and Verification Standard. 
The goal is to advance the guide & standard, including (but not limited to) the sections dealing with integration of security into the mobile app development process.  

We'd need flights and accommodation provided by OWASP as our company won't sponsor the trip - please let us know soon if this will be possible, as we'll need to announce & prepare the workshop.

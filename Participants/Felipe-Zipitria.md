## Felipe Zipitria

I want to participate in several meetings of owasp project. As I work in a University, I'm very interested in the Application Security BSc/Masters Curriculum Design. There are other Workshops that I think I could make contributions.

I will need flights and accommodation provided by OWASP as my University won't sponsor the trip - please let us know soon if this will be possible.

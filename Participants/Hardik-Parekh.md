[ I am one of the core contributors for OpenSAMM 2.0. I would like to attend OWASP summit so that I can participate in OpenSAMM 2.0 discussions.
The goal is to advance OpenSAMM to include security practices related to DevOps agile methology as part of v2.0. I would also like to propose new OWASP project and discuss the same with OWASP leaders.  

I would need flights and accommodation provided by OWASP as my company won't sponsor the trip - please let us know soon if this would be possible, as I'll need to prepare the material.

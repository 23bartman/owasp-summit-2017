## Kim Carter

NodeGoat is the next gen WebGoat, written in NodeJS, It comes with a tutorial covering the OWASP Top 10 + other vulnerabilties. NodeGoat also has a Security Regression Testing Proof of Concept (PoC) using the Zap API which is getting a lot of use in [training teams](https://blog.binarymist.net/presentations-publications/) around the importance of moving security from the most expensive place (go-live) to the cheapest (within the Development Teams Sprints). Based on [this PoC](https://github.com/binarymist/NodeGoat/wiki/Security-Regression-Testing-with-Zap-API), I've sold and implemented Security Regression Testing with Zap API within a large international companies development team and seen amazing results. I would like to move this forward, increase the coverage, add feature defects, get all compoenents and their docker images working in a nightly build to further demonstrate the huge advantages of moving security left and also demonstrate how useful Zap can be in the build process.

I would need flights and accommodation provided by OWASP as I've been working for the love of security in our industry mostly on my book series "Holistic Info-Sec for Web Developers" without income for many months - please let me know soon if this will be possible, as I will need to announce and prepare the workshop, and refrain from submitting further presentations and workshops around these dates.

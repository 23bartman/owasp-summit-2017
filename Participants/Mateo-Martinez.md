## Mateo Martinez

I want to participate in several meetings of owasp project. Discuss about Latam region chapters needs. I want to create a workshop about student chapters.
If I can participate on the CISO and OpenSAMM worskshop as well will be grat.

We'd need flights and accommodation provided by OWASP as our company won't sponsor the trip - please let us know soon if this will be possible, as we'll need to announce & prepare the workshop.

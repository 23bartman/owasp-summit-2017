A janitorial contributor to various OWASP projects, spending most of his time using OWASP applications and occasionally cleaning up typos. I am interested in the following remote sessions:

* OWASP Top 10
* Testing Guide V5
* OWASP ZAP
and a few more that are still under development.


### Participating in

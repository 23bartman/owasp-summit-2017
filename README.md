### Initial Vision

> **Owasp Summit 2017, England, April 2017**
>
> OWASP is joining forces with DevSecCon to create a Summit focused on the collaboration between
Developers and Application Security.
>
> This is not a conference with uni-directional presentations, this is a working summit with working sessions on areas like:
> * Secure Coding, Security Testing/TDD, DevOps,
> * Threat Modeling, Mobile Security, IoT
> * Risk & Governance, Privacy & CTO/CISO requirements
> * Secure Design, Bug-bounties
> * [Browser Security](./Workshops/Browser-security.md), AI for Attack & Defence
> * DDoS, Cyber Warfare, AppSec Standards;
>
>... and of course, working sessions on popular OWASP projects (lead by its leaders) such as:
> * Zap, Top 10, Dependency Checker
> * OwaspSAMM, OWASP Guides (Testing, ASVS, Core Review)
> * AppSensor and dozens more.
>
> Using the same model as the past two OWASP Summits in Portugal, this 5 day event will be a 16h day high energy experience, where the attendees are expected to work and collaborate really hard. Every working session will be thoroughly prepared and focused on actionable outcomes.
>
> If you care about Application Security and want to collaborate with the key players in this industry, this is the event to be.
>
> The Summit will occur in England, April or June 2017, with an entry ticket of $2000 (covering travel + hotel + accommodation + event fee). OWASP is funding a large number of its leaders and other deserving individuals to attend, so if you feel you can't afford this fee, or your company is not in a position to sponsor you, please contact the event organisers.

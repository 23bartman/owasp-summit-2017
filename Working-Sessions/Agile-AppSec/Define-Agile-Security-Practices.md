## Why

The idea of using Agile in Security Practices/Activites is one that makes a lot of sense. But what does it mean?

This Working Session will aim to define those Practices in easy to use and scalable formats (and documentation).

## What

 - What are 'Agile Security Practices'?
 - How can they be measured
 - Who is already doing it? (and are they called 'Agile Security Practices')
 - Can a focused and pragmatic list of 'Agile Security Practices' be defined? (and if so, what is it?)

## Who

The target audience for this Working Session is:

- Security professionals
- CISO's
- Agile practitioners
- DevSecOps
- SecDevOps

Integrating security into the sales channels is of extreme importance to every organisation that has a strong sales driven component. In most of the cases the ability to oversee the current sales streams which are involving various different products is quite limited and requires information security professionals an additional effort and process re-engineering in order to get that ability. 

## Why

Usually these organisations are utilising B2B model and most of the requirements for new components and features are coming in directly from the customer.

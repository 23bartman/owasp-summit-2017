It seems AppSec is a nascent area for a lot of CISOs - you have secured the outside, you know where the traffic is going. You have a handle on data use and storage. But what are your apps doing? 

## Why

Why? Don't you want to know? What is going to be coming? What is there already? Don't you want to shape this, guide this and ensure there aren't any nasty surprises?

## What

What to look out for, how to build teams and policies, what frameworks to look out for, technologies, hints and tips.

## Who

CISOs, Tech Leads and Architects

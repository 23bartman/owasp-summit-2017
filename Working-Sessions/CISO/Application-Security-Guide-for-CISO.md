Among application security stakeholders, Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) are responsible for application security from governance, compliance and risk perspectives. This guide seeks to help CISOs manage application security programs according to CISO roles, responsibilities, perspectives and needs. Application security best practices and OWASP resources are referenced throughout this guide. OWASP is a non profit organization whose mission is "making application security visible and empowering application security stakeholders with the right information for managing application security risks".

## Why

Cyber Insurance is already a large market, but how well is it working (and how cost-effective is it)

## What

 - Common Cyber Insurance terms and coverage
 - How insurance companies measure risk
 - Should insurance companies lead the need for common standards and labels
 - Should governments provide/buy Cyber Insurance for its citizens (and companies)
 - How can organizations like OWASP work with Insurance companies

## Who

 - Insurance Companies
 - CISO

## Why

In 2017 the AppSec industry is only only $1B - $1.5B of an $81B market (growing ~15%).

If AppSec is really the key to solve the 'security problem' we face today (and will face even more in the future) we will need a lot more
investment and focus in AppSec solutions (people, process and technology)

## What

 - Why is the AppSec marked so small?
 - What can be done to increase it?
 - What is the role of OWASP in increasing this market? (what should its community focus on?)
 - Is the market size a reflection that at the moment the number of 'damaging' attacks is still (relatively) small and that companies can safely afford not to invest in AppSec?
 - What is the role of Open Source tools in the AppSec market?
 - Are patents and 'technology lock' good or bad for the industry?

## Who

 - OWASP Community

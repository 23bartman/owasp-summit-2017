Developers, operations and security teams need to collaborate on building and verifying that cloud architectures meet requirements for security.  Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) may be a useful tool to both specify and then verify that the appropriate security controls are in place.   

## Objectives

- Identify core security requirements for all cloud deployements, regardless of specific cloud technology.
- Write BDD specs for those requirements (no implementation code, just spec)
- Link specs to standards (CSA, NIST, etc)

## Who

Cloud Security Architects
Security Teams
Cloud Ops

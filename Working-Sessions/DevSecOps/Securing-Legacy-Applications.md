## Why

There has been enormous security progress in the new languages/frameworks, which make it harder to write insecure applications (at least from an injection point of view)

The big elephant in the room are the hundreds/thousands applications that exist in companies, which perform mission critical functions, and will go anywhere anytime soom.

## What

 - How to map legacy applications
 - How to understand the risk posed by these applications
 - Who should own maintain these applications
 - Can these applications be used an an opportunity to implement DevOps practices
 - How to insure these applications
 - How SAST technology tends to be very effective in legacy applications

## Who

 - CISO
 - Insurance Companies

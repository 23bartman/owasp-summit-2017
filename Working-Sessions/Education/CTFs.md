### Context

In this working session we can share our experience with various CTF
formats, tools and frameworks.

- Open sources frameworks(like [CTFd](https://ctfd.io) or
  [FBCTF](https://github.com/facebook/fbctf))
- Experience gained from OWASP University Challenge sessions
- How to suppor different "modes" in training applications (i.e.
  lesson-mode, exercise-mode, awareness-mode and CTF-mode)
- How to organize your own CTF session for an OWASP Chapter Meeting
  (e.g. with the help of
  [OWASP Virtual Village](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Virtual_Village_Project)
  resources)

### Potential Outcome

- TODO

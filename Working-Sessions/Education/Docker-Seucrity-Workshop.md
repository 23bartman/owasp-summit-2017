## Why
As every modern company integrates docker, a workshop is needed to show the potential risks. Most risks are not new, but have higher impacts.

## What
As a starting point, the workshop from (Timo Pagel)[https://github.com/wurstbrot/docker-security-workshop] will be used. 

## Outcome
The outcome will be a workshop, integrated into the OWASP Education Project. The hands on workshop will have:
- a small concept
- a training environment (e.g. virtualbox/vagrant/docker) and
- slides

## Who
- Docker Security Experts
- Users of docker with the wish to learn more about docker

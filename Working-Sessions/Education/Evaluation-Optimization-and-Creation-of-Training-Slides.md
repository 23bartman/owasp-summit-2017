### Context
Security trainings have a high priority in many security frameworks like OWASP OpenSAMM. In some Agile Security Lifecycles trainings are mandatory before you start with anything else.
To start with trainings, you need slides with different scopes.

### What
In this workshop we will:
* Determine the needs for training slides, as there are university courses, one week trainings, one day trainings and one hour trainings. In Addition, the skills in secrurity of developers vary a lot.
* Share existing training slides and discous the pros and cons, slides are for example [WebapSec in a Nutshell (short)](http://webappsec-nutshell.kimminich.de/#/), [Web Application Security Training (long one)](https://de.slideshare.net/BjrnKimminich/web-application-security-21684264), [University Module (very long)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2KKdB7MPO7xTEwtWkkwTnl5VFk)
* Share ideas about how to structure training slides
* Share ideas about how to create training slides for different audience, without having redundant slides in different training slides
* Share ideas about how to document interactive demonstrations, which are often not part of training slides
* Optimization of training slides

### Potential Outcome
Participents will have an overview of existing sources for training slides. 
Existing slides will be more structured.

### Who
* Web Application Security Trainers
* Web Application Security Researchers
* Security Champions

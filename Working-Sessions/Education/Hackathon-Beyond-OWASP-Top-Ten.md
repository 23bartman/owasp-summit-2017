## Why

In this hackathon, Participants can experience a large set of security challenges ranging from web security to DevSecOps. The session is run on the [avatao](https://avatao.com) platform, that is an online tool to offer hands-on ITsec challenges. The goal is primarily to have fun, but also to gather feedback from the participants on the platform and ideas for new challenges for AppSec professionals.

## What

Planned topics for the hackathon: 
- web security, 
- API security,
- testing (BDD),
- security misconfigurations,
- Docker security,
- secure coding in C, 
- secure coding in Java, 
- security tools tutorials (Wireshark, Unicorn Engine),
- crypto and protocol security,
- hacker stuff (pwn, RE) on demand


## Outcomes

- having fun 
- learn new vulnerabilities and past epic failures ([Yahoo Mail stored XSS](https://klikki.fi/adv/yahoo2.html))
- collect new ideas for security challenges (secure coding in X, GDPR)
- Suggested Outcome: A list of important security topics for developers. A list of challenge ideas by topic. 

## Who

The target audience for this Working Session is:

- Developers (anyone interested in web and low-level languages)
- Security professionals
- CTF participants (and those who would like to become one)
- CISOs

## Why

In this hackathon, Participants can experience a large set of security challenges ranging from web security to DevSecOps. The session is run on the [avatao](https://avatao.com) platform, that is an online tool to offer a wide variety of hands-on ITsec challenges. We demonstrate how deep the rabbit hole can be of challenges in terms of architecture, programming languages or design. Avatao contains more than 400 real challenges to achieve this. The session can be useful for anyone who would like to get hands-on experience with cutting edge technologies (e.g., Unicorn Engine, Kaitai Struct) that shape our security today or solve more traditional challenges in web security or Java.

The primary goal however is to have fun and gather feedback from the participants on the platform and ideas for new challenges for AppSec professionals.



## What

Planned topics for the hackathon: 
- web security, 
- API security,
- testing (BDD),
- security misconfigurations,
- Docker security,
- secure coding in C, 
- secure coding in Java, 
- security tools tutorials (Wireshark, Unicorn Engine),
- crypto and protocol security,
- hacker stuff (pwn, RE) on demand


## Outcomes

- having fun 
- learn new vulnerabilities and past epic failures ([Yahoo Mail stored XSS](https://klikki.fi/adv/yahoo2.html))
- hands-on experience with cutting edge ITSec technologies (e.g., Kaitai Struct, Unicorn Engine)
- collect new ideas for security challenges (secure coding in X, GDPR)


## Who

The target audience for this Working Session is:

- Developers (anyone interested in web and low-level languages)
- Security professionals
- CTF participants (and those who would like to become one)
- CISOs


## Remote Participants

All the challenges will be available online so anyone can join us even remotely.

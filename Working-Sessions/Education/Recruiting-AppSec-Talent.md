## Why

AppSec and InfoSec talent is really hard to find these days. There is also a challenge in opening up the industry to
professionals with experience in other fields, who could cross over to security, but lack a clear roadmap on how to get into the field. 
On the other hand, many talented professionals have a difficult time finding a position that fits their abilities, and are often unhappy with their current employment. There are also a great many just starting out in the industry, and without a track record cannot prove to a potential employer what they can achieve.   
All the while, there is a sore lack and high demand for professionals that can get the job done.

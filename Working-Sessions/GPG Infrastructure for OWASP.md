# GPG Infrastructure for OWASP

### Objective

OWASP generates, delivers and hosts a bunch of dokuments and tools which are widely accepted for their high quality. But there is no mechanism to mark these projects (project - in OWASP speek) tamper-proof.
OWASP needs an organisational and technical infrastructe to sign documents and code. GPG should be the solution.

### Audience / To Invite

* Board Members
* Technical Staff

### Expected Outcome

* organisational infrastructure: e-mail adresses, people who "own" the keys, trust chain
* technical infrastructure: e-mail adresses, owasp.org/GPG
* at least leaders should have an GPG key signed by OWASP's "master key" at end of the summit
* TBD â€¦

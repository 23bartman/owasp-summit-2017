> [OWASP Juice Shop Project](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Juice_Shop_Project "OWASP Juice Shop Project")
> is an intentionally insecure webapp for security training written
> entirely in JavaScript and which encompasses the entire OWASP Top Ten and
> other severe security flaws. Juice Shop is written in Node.js, Express,
> and AngularJS. The application contains more than 30 challenges of
> varying difficulty where the user should exploit the
> underlying vulnerabilities. Apart from being useful for hacker and awareness
> training, pentesting proxies or security scanners can also use
> Juice Shop as a "guinea pig" application to check how well their tools
> cope with JavaScript-heavy application frontends and REST APIs.

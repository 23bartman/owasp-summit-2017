## Mobile Security

Organizer(s): [Bernhard Mueller](../Participants/Bernhard-Mueller.html) , [Sven Schleier](../Participants/Sven-Schleier.html)


### Summary

If you are interested in creating the industry standard for mobile security testing, this is the place to be. This workshop will focus on filling the gaps in the [Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG)](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg) and getting acceptance from the community.


### Main Goal - Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG)

During the last few months the Mobile Security Testing Guide has made huge steps forward and several parts of the MSTG have now already a draft version. Please have a look at the [GitBook](https://b-mueller.gitbooks.io/owasp-mobile-security-testing-guide/content/) and the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg).

As we want to push things forward in order to have a first draft of the Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG) at the end of Q2, Bernhard and Sven will be holding a mobile security workshop during the OWASP Summit.

The main goals of the five days workshop are:

* Close all existing issues in our GitHub project,
* enhance the overall quality through QA of the existing content.

As preparation for the workshop, open tasks were converted into issues and organized as a [GitHub project](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/projects/1). Thanks again to Romuald for taking the initiative. This project will be the basis for our ongoing work, but also for the OWASP Summit in particular.

In order to be able to schedule work during the summit and create work groups we need to know who will be attending the OWASP Summit and how much time you can/will spend for the mobile workshop. Please reach out directly to Sven via Slack, [see here](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg#contributions-feature-requests-and-feedback) on how to contact us via Slack .

If you do not have time during the summit but are interested to help, you can start immediately by assigning issues to yourself and creating pull requests. We can potentially also loop you in remotely during the submit.

Let's work on the testing guide and fix mobile application security!


### Additional Goal - Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS)
* Working on MASVS - https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs
* MASVS Review and Editing


### Additional Goal - Hacking-Playground
* Working on Mobile Hacking Playground, https://github.com/OWASP/OMTG-Hacking-Playground
* Working on curriculum/study material for mobile education purpose in trainings and Working-Sessions.
   * Offensive: For penetration testers / security researchers to identify bad practices, dangerous methods and classes they should look at when assessing a Mobile App. Goal is to gain more knowledge through the information provided in the MSTG.
   * Defensive: For developers to identify vulnerable code in the provided Appâ€™s so they can see the implications and risks if such patterns are used and can look for the best practices in the MSTG to mitigate the vulnerabilities.


### Questions to answer

Answering the following questions will help us to improve the quality and the practicability of the MSTG:

* How can requirements from MASVS be integrated into Agile environments?
* What are pain points at the moment in Mobile Security development, when considering/implementing security?
* What are pain points at the moment for Penetration Testers and QA testers when testing mobile Apps?
* How can testing be automated (and what makes sense to automate) for Penetration Testers and QA Testers, e.g. by utilizing
  * BDD
  * MobSF
* How can mobile developers be trained to code securely?
* How can (Penetration/QA) testers be trained to identify vulnerabilites in weak implemented mobile Apps?


### Participant candidates
* Mobile Developers
* iOS/Android security researchers
* Representatives from Android / Apple iOS
* Representatives from Mobile Frameworks

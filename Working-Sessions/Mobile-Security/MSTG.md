During the last few months the Mobile Security Testing Guide has made huge steps forward and several parts of the MSTG have now already a draft version. Please have a look at the [GitBook](https://b-mueller.gitbooks.io/owasp-mobile-security-testing-guide/content/) and the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg).

As we want to push things forward in order to have a first draft of the Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG) at the end of Q2, Bernhard and Sven will be holding a mobile security workshop during the OWASP Summit.

The main goals of the five days workshop are:

* Close all existing issues in our GitHub project,
* enhance the overall quality through QA of the existing content.

As preparation for the workshop, open tasks were converted into issues and organized as a [GitHub project](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/projects/1). Thanks again to Romuald for taking the initiative. This project will be the basis for our ongoing work, but also for the OWASP Summit in particular.

In order to be able to schedule work during the summit and create work groups we need to know who will be attending the OWASP Summit and how much time you can/will spend for the mobile workshop. Please put your name as one of the participants and reach out directly to Sven via Slack, [see here](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg#contributions-feature-requests-and-feedback) on how to contact us via Slack .

If you do not have time during the summit but are interested to help, you can start immediately by assigning issues to yourself and creating pull requests. We can potentially also loop you in remotely during the submit.



Let's work on the testing guide and fix mobile application security!

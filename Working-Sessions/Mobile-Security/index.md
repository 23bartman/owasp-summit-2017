### Questions to answer

Answering the following questions will help us to improve the quality and the practicability of the MSTG:

* How can requirements from MASVS be integrated into Agile environments?
* What are pain points at the moment in Mobile Security development, when considering/implementing security?
* What are pain points at the moment for Penetration Testers and QA testers when testing mobile Apps?
* How can testing be automated (and what makes sense to automate) for Penetration Testers and QA Testers, e.g. by utilizing
  * BDD
  * MobSF
* How can mobile developers be trained to code securely?
* How can (Penetration/QA) testers be trained to identify vulnerabilites in weak implemented mobile Apps?

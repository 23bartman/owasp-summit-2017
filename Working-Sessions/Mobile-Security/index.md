### Summary

This track focuses on mobile application security. It is organized by the project leaders of the [OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Mobile_Security_Testing_Guide) project. The main focus of this track is completing the [OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg).

If you are interested in setting the industry standard for mobile security testing, this is the place to be. 

#### About the OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide Project

This project produces two key documents: A *security standard* for mobile apps, and a *testing guide* that augments the requirements in the security standard detailed, OS-specific test cases and secure coding recommendations.

### Working Sessions

We will hold a single working session focused on producing content for the OWASP MSTG, as well as proof-reading and editing of the existing content. The goal is to make as much progress on the guide as humanly possible. Depending on the number of participants, we'll split into sub-groups that work on different subsections or topic areas. See the working session page for more information.

### Summary

This track focuses on mobile application security. It is organized by the project leaders of the [OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Mobile_Security_Testing_Guide) project. The main focus of this track is completing the [OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg).

If you are interested in setting the industry standard for mobile security testing, this is the place to be. 

#### About the OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide Project

This project produces two key documents: A *security standard* for mobile apps, and a *testing guide* that augments the requirements in the security standard detailed, OS-specific test cases and secure coding recommendations. 

##### The Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG)

</td><td>
The MSTG is comprehensive guide for iOS and Android mobile security testers. It covers the processes, techniques, and tools used during a mobile app security test, as well as an exhaustive set of test cases that enables testers to deliver consistent and complete results.

##### The Mobile App Security Verification Standard (MASVS)

<table><tr><td>

</td><td>
The MASVS is a standard for mobile app security. It can be used by mobile software architects and developers seeking to develop secure mobile applications, as well as security testers to ensure completeness and consistency of test results. The latest release is version 0.9.3.

### Questions to answer

Answering the following questions will help us to improve the quality and the practicability of the MSTG:

* How can requirements from MASVS be integrated into Agile environments?
* What are pain points at the moment in Mobile Security development, when considering/implementing security?
* What are pain points at the moment for Penetration Testers and QA testers when testing mobile Apps?
* How can testing be automated (and what makes sense to automate) for Penetration Testers and QA Testers, e.g. by utilizing
  * BDD
  * MobSF
* How can mobile developers be trained to code securely?
* How can (Penetration/QA) testers be trained to identify vulnerabilites in weak implemented mobile Apps?

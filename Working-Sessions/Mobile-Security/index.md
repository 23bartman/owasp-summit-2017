### Summary

If you are interested in creating the industry standard for mobile security testing, this is the place to be. This workshop will focus on filling the gaps in the [Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG)](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg) and getting acceptance from the community.

### Questions to answer

Answering the following questions will help us to improve the quality and the practicability of the MSTG:

* How can requirements from MASVS be integrated into Agile environments?
* What are pain points at the moment in Mobile Security development, when considering/implementing security?
* What are pain points at the moment for Penetration Testers and QA testers when testing mobile Apps?
* How can testing be automated (and what makes sense to automate) for Penetration Testers and QA Testers, e.g. by utilizing
  * BDD
  * MobSF
* How can mobile developers be trained to code securely?
* How can (Penetration/QA) testers be trained to identify vulnerabilites in weak implemented mobile Apps?


### Participant candidates
* Mobile Developers
* iOS/Android security researchers
* Representatives from Android / Apple iOS
* Representatives from Mobile Frameworks

(add details, why, what, who)


_(notes from email thread on owasp-leaders list)_


_Workshop (or more than one) dedicated to the Owasp Website (after all the Summit will be the place with the highest concentration of Owasp Leaders and Contributors with time dedicated to work on activities like this)_

_As with the project's review, I think that this kind of activity/transformation should be done and driven by Owasp Leaders and Contributors working together (vs buying a tool or hiring external services)_

_What would be great is if we had a Villa (with 6 to 8 participants) dedicated to working and improving the Owasp Website_

_From a sponsorship/cost point of view this would be 10 to 15k (depending on fights costs), which I think would be a great investment for Owasp._

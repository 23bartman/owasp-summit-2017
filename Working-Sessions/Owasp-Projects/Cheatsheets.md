## What

- Bring together Cheat sheets creators and users
- Workshop ideas:
  - Working Sessions on improving existing Cheat sheets, debating finer details of their content, and creating new ones
  - Work on an updated version of the Cheat sheets book https://www.owasp.org/images/9/9a/OWASP_Cheatsheets_Book.pdf (maybe adding it to Leanpub and Amazon)
- Plan next steps and what should be worked on next (after the Summit)
- Question: What would be a realistic deliverable for the Summit?

## Definition of Done

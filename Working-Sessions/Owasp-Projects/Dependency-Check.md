OWASP Dependency-Check is more than a simple tool, it consists of an entire ecosystem of components and projects that all work together to provide insight and visibility into the use of vulnerable components. An overview of the state-of-the-art of the ODC/ODT ecosystem will be demonstrated along with a gap analysis of areas where future work may be necessary.

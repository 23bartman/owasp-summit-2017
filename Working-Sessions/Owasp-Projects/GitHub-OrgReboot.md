> The [OWASP GitHub organization](https://github.com/owasp) hosts some
> of the foundation's greatest projects. Unfortunately there is lots of
> rubble obstructing access to them. GitHub has become kind of a
> de-facto standard for OSS projects and using this platform and
> associated ecosystem of SaaS to its full potential could make a big
> difference when it comes to gaining new contributors.

### Context

* What makes GitHub so special among its peers?
* How are other successful OSS organizations using GitHub?
* How can OWASP use GitHub more to its benefit?
* How high should the quality bar for OWASP org repositories be in the
  future?
* What are best practices and user expectations for OSS these days?
* How can we prevent new erosion after a "tabula rasa" cleanup or
  "reboot"?

### Potential outcomes

* GitHub repository owner guidelines
* GitHub org admin guidelines
* Addendum to the Project Leader Handbook specific for Code and Tool
  projects
* Extended/New quality checklist for Code and Tool projects
* Templates (e.g. `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` etc.) for a
  repo under OWASP org
* Instructions for 3rd party QA/CI tool setup (e.g. Travis-CI,
  Codeclimate etc.)

### Participant candidates

* Project leaders of OWASP Code or Tool projects
* Contributors to OWASP Code or Tool projects
* Software engineers/craftsmen
* GitHub powerusers

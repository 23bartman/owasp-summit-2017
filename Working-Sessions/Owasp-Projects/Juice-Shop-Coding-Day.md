## Why

> [OWASP Juice Shop Project](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Juice_Shop_Project "OWASP Juice Shop Project")
> is an intentionally insecure webapp for security training written
> entirely in JavaScript and which encompasses the entire OWASP Top Ten
> and other severe security flaws. Juice Shop is written in Node.js,
> Express, and AngularJS. The application contains more than 30
> challenges of varying difficulty where the user should exploit the
> underlying vulnerabilities. Apart from being useful for hacker and
> awareness training, pentesting proxies or security scanners can also
> use Juice Shop as a "guinea pig" application to check how well their
> tools cope with JavaScript-heavy application frontends and REST APIs.

## What

Hands-on coding session series to implement the
[OWASP Summit 2017 Challenge Pack](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/milestone/3)
and other functional enhancements to the web application & CTF-extension
identified in the [Juice Shop](Juice-Shop.md) session!

## Outcomes

This working session will implement the following:

- Several new challenges for OWASP Juice Shop
- Functional enhancements to place the challenges in, e.g. the
  [Order Dashboard](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/issues/244)
  and
  [~~Pomace Recycling~~](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/issues/243)(_done!_)
- Hint and solution sections for each new challenge are added to the
  "Pwning OWASP Juice Shop" e-book
- Functional and convenience improvements to the Juice Shop
  CTF-extension

To keep the high release stability and overall quality of OWASP Juice
Shop
[the contribution rules of the project](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
apply for the summit results as well:

- Code follows existing style guides and passes all existing quality
  gates regarding code smells, test coverage etc.
- Each challenge comes with fully functional unit and integration tests
- Each challenge is verified to be exploitable by corresponding
  end-to-end tests

## Who

The target audience for this Working Session is:

- JavaScript developers (Knowledge of Node.js would be great but is _not
  mandatory_)
- Web developers (Knowledge of Angular 1.x would be great but is _not
  mandatory_)
- Web designers (the vulnerable features will _at least look good_)
- CTFd project team and contributors

### Remote Participants

This working session is pariculartly well-suited for remote
participants. All you have to do is let the on-site participants know
which challenges or feature you want to work on in order to avoid
duplicate work! Then it's up to you:

> **Fork, clone, code, submit PRs!**

All that in your own speed and schedule!

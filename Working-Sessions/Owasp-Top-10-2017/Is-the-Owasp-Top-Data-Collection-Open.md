## Why

Owasp Top 10 is one of the most important and recognized Owasp project. Owasp reputation and value for the AppSec
 community is very depended on the O part of OWASP (Open).

The current RC version of the Owasp Top 10 2017 has generated quite a number of voices that questioned the openness
 level of process used and the potential conflict of interest of author.

Meanwhile the authors have claimed that this was the most Open process so far.

The Summit presents an opportunity to clarify this situation and for evidence to be presented and discussed on both
 sides of the argument.

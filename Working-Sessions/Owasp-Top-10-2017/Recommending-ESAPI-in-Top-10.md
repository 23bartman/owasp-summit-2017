## Why

EASPI is recommended in multiple places in the new Owasp Top 10 RC1.

> However, the quality of OWASP resources will generally be based on how much effort its unpaid volunteers are able or willing to put in and how much assistance they receive. For example, the OWASP ESAPI (Enterprise Security API) project was at one time a flagship project but was “demoted”, an action which its Java project owner agreed with. Its wiki page now recommends considering other alternatives before considering ESAPI.

## Why

Any issue that is part of the Owasp Top 10 should match a very specific Selection/Inclusion Criteria.

This criteria has to be clear, easy to understand, agreed by the community, measurable and when applied to the
   top 10, it should make sense why those specific categories where selected.

> In the Big 4 context, this is relevant for “Auditor Independence” where a Financial Auditor firm and its staff must demonstrate that they are able to perform a completely unbiased review of a company’s financial reporting without being exposed to external pressures which prevent it from being impartial such as a financial interest or inducement.
>
>  We were told that a Financial Auditor must both “be independent” and “be seen to be independent”. This second definition effectively means that even something that just looks like it would threaten independence, even if it does not, should be considered as a risk and avoided as carefully as an actual independence risk.

Given the controversy surrounding the current Top 10 2017 RC1, this is even more important to get right.

The purpose of the OWASP Chapter Handbook and the OWASP Chapter Leader Handbook is to provide chapter leaders with a central place to find information about starting a chapter, organizing a chapter meeting, handling their chapter finances, and many other topics that come up in the course of running a chapter.  
The Handbook is currently undergoing review, and the updated version is currently in draft. 
The purpose of this Session is to discuss any open issues and reach consensus. We should also uncover new issues especially as relates to atypical chapters and the disparate manners of chapter operation.  


## Questions / Tasks
- How can we simplify the Handbook(s)?
- In what ways can we get new chapters, and new chapter leaders, up to speed most efficiently? 
- How do we validate "compliance"?
- Requirement update process
- New requirements
- <List of specific issues to discuss?> 

## Potential outcomes

- All outcomes are not final, and will serve as input for Foundation

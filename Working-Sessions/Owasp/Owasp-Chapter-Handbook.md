The joint purpose of the OWASP Chapter Handbook and the OWASP Chapter Leader Handbook is to provide chapter leaders with a central repository of information about starting a chapter, organising a chapter meeting, handling chapter finances, etc.   
The Handbook is currently under review, and the updated version is currently in draft form. 
This Working Session will discuss and agree on any open issues. The session will also consider new issues, particularly those relating to atypical chapters and the different styles of chapter operations.  

## What

- How can we simplify the Handbook(s)?
- How can we ensure that new chapters, and new chapter leaders, are kept informed of new developments? 
- How do we validate "compliance"?
- Requirement update process
- New requirements
- <List of specific issues to discuss?> 

## Potential outcomes

- Clarifying responsibilities and accountabilities
- Updated draft
- One-page cheat sheets for:
    - chapter leaders 
    - new leaders 
    - creating a new chapter
- All outcomes are not final, and will serve as input for Foundation

## Who

Tasks, accountability and transparency: Local OWASP chapters deal with a lot of money - chapters DO have to justify outcomes and chapter fund balances in a legal, fiscal and ethical manner.

## Questions / Tasks
- How to get an overview over chapter incomes and spendings?
- Compliance: Which legal standards and regulations do we have to consider in general?
- Are local chapter members accountable?
- Who is controlling expenses, how do we assure dual-control-principle?
- Which kind of physical assets can a chapter buy? Who is monitoring those assets and where are they kept?
- Should we publish local chapter incomes and spendings?

## Potential outcomes
- Clarifying responsibilities and accountabilities
- Set of rules: what should be and what has to be recorded? In which way? 
- One-page cheat sheat for chapter treasurers
- All outcomes may serve as a proposal which has to be discussed with foundation

## Who
- Anyone who is or may be responsible for chapter funds
- Members of foundation dealing with funding and/or financial matters

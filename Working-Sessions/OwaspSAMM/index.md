We organise several [OWASP SAMM](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_SAMM_Project) Working-Sessions as part of the OWASP summit.

The SAMM Summit is not a regular conference with speaking slots, but a summit where the participants work together in a 5-day sprint on SAMMv2. If you are interested to contribute to this, you are most welcome (knowledge of SAMM or other secure development methodology experience is a prerequisite).

This is an excellent opportunity to influence the direction of SAMM and exchange experiences with your peers.

## Objectives
Main objectives for the 2017 SAMM Summit are:

1. Draft SAMM2, the "DevOps release"
2. Assure SAMM leverages other OWASP projects as part of the SAMM practices

## Working-Sessions

1. Review and improve the 12 SAMM practices towards SAMM v2.0 draft (based on the notes of last year's summit and the SAMM calls)
2. Update the SAMM model to take into account Agile and DevOps development and operation practices
3. Include OWASP projects as resources for the SAMM practices in SAMM v2.0 (started online [here](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:SAMM-Resources))
4. using Maturity Models project on OSAMM data (see related [Maturity-Models](Maturity-Models.html) Working-Sessions
5. ... (add Working-Sessions here by editing the [GitHub page](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-summit-2017/edit/master/Working-Sessions/SAMM.md))

### Introdution

Owasp Orizon is a source code static analyzer tool designed to spot security
issues in Java applications.

Owasp Orizon mission is to provide people an opensource tool, helping them in reviewing:

* single Java classes
* Java standalone tools packed in JAR files
* web applications packed in EAR / WAR files
* Android APK applications

### Some story

It was a dark and stormy night in Milan, Italy. It was 2006 and I felt the need
of something helping me in reviewing other people java source code. So Owasp
Orizon born and grew up as security tool trying to parse Java source code,
building an Abstract Syntax Tree and spot for unsafe calls in the code.

In the very beginning Owasp Orizon was a sort of enhanced grep tool. In 2008, I
started supporting PHP programming language but the initial boost disappeared.
After being in love with other programming languages and technolgies, eight
years later, in 2017 I kickstarted the project again from scratch.

### What it will be discussed?

* What people really need from a SAST tool?
* How Orizon will integrate with Dependency Checker and Owasp ZAP?
* Only J2EE or even Android support?

### Outcomes

* A team of people interesting in working on it
* Some agile milestones

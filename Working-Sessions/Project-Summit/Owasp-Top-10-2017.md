Working Session to collaborate on the implications of the new OWASP Top 10

## Why

With a new version of the OWASP top 10 being released very soon, there are number of
hot topics that need further discussion and debated.

## What

- Are the changes proposed in the 2017 version representative of what is happening in the AppSec's ecosystem?
- Does the data-sets available confirm the chosen Top 10 items?
- Is this new version too much 'tool-vendor driven' or does it strike a good balance?
- What is the impact for companies and tool vendors?
- What is the best way to use this new version?
- List areas where the Top 10 should be used, and explicitly list where it shouldn't
- _.... What else should it be covered in this Working Session?...._

## Who

- Security Professionals
- AppSec teams
- Tool vendors

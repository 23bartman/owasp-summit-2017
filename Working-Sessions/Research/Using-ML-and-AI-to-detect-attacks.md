Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are reaching mainstream and provide a great opportunity for defenders.

## Why

We are now in the cusp of a Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence revolution. These techniques have recently re-emerged as a powerful tools in multiple business sectors like Fraud Detection, Anomaly Detection, Behavioral Analysis, etc. There are already several companies and services that are exploring these technologies and have successfully used them to solve specific security challenges 

Although these applications have huge success, there are security risks associated with these techniques especially during the learning phase; which can still be vulnerable to threats originated by potential adversaries, and consequently it has considerable impact on their prediction results 

This Working Session will share common practices, what works today and what is worth focusing on in the future


## What
 - What are the available machine learning platforms.
 - Any security vulnerabilities associated with these platforms.
 - How to securely feed data to ML and AI tools?
 - How to make learning algorithms aware of malicious data?
 - Can AI be used to reduce false positive findings in security scanners?
 - How can we spread the message among developers and security communities 

## Who

 - Security professionals
 - ML and AI researchers
 - Devops
 - SOC teams

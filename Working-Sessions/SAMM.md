## OwaspSAMM

We will organise several OWASP SAMM(https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_SAMM_Project) Working-Sessions as part of the OWASP summit.
The SAMM Summit is not a regular conference with speaking slots, but a summit where the participants work together in a 5-day sprint on SAMMv2.
If you are interested to contribute to this, you are most welcome (knowledge of SAMM or other secure development methodology experience is a prerequisite)
This is an excellent opportunity to influence the direction of SAMM and exchange experiences with your peers.

Main objectives are:

1) release SAMM2, the "DevOps release"

2) assure SAMM is integrated with the other OWASP projects

Working-Sessions

1) using Maturity Models project on OSAMM data (see related [Maturity-Models](Maturity-Models.html) Working-Sessions

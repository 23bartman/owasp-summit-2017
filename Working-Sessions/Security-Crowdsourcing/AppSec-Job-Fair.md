## Why

A number of Summit Participants will be looking for new challenges and opportunities in 2017. This Working Session
 (most likely to happen in one of the evenings) will be a place for companies and recruiters to bring their
 interesting job opportunities and share them with the participants (in an anonymous format, or not).

This will also be a good place to have good conversions about what kind of security careers and opportunities
 are out there, and what kind of skills are in high demand.

## What

 - companies and recruiters to present job opportunities
 - informal conversions about the current state of the job market
 - explore the concept of working 2 days a week on a specific project (while employed by another company)

## Who

 - companies and recruiters looking for talent
 - talent looking for new opportunities

Given the current skills shortage in all fields of security, it is key that we maximize resource and opportunities (for
 talent looking for interesting/profitable engagements and companies looking for talent)

## Why

There is a huge amount of security talent that today is not available for hire. On the other hand there a companies who
are desperate for specific kinds of skills (even if it is just a a couple hours/days a week)

## What

 - Create an engagement model for an marketplace for all skills levels (from CISOs, to Senior Ops directors, Threat Modeling experts, security developers, etc...)
 - Review the legality and operation details of such engagements
 - Define the kinds of organizations that could be used as proxies/facilitators
 - Is the 'Artist Agent' model a good one to follow?
 - What is the financial model that makes sense for both talent and hiring companies?
 - Is Owasp Leadership a good benchmark for talent?

## Who

 - Security professionals
 - Companies looking for talent
 - Companies looking to provide such services

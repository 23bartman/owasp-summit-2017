## Why

Handling external submissions of security vulnerabilities via Bug Bounty Programs (or directly) is not an trivial task and should
    not be left to chance.

It is critical that very specific workflows are followed so that not only the original issue is addressed, but any possible variations
    are discovered and (if required) fixed.

Also very important is to have very focused and technically correct exchanges with the external individual(s) that submitted the
    security vulnerability.

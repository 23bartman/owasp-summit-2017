## Why

Playbooks contain specific workflows which need to be executed in a particular sequence.

Jira is a widely used tool by developers and security teams, which means that if Jira Workflows of Security Playbooks exist,
  we will have a scalable and easy to deploy solution for using the playbooks.

Jira Workflows also have the advantage of providing Kanban boards and dashboards (important for management reporting).

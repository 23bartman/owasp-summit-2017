## Why

Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks are not only becoming more common, they are moving up the stack.

In the past, DoS used to be very Network based (sending large number of similar requests), which could be detected and
    mitigated at the edge of the network. New generation of DoS generate much less traffic, while being very effective (by
    targeting parts of the application that are computationally expensive)

When that happens, it is very important that very clean workflows (aka playbooks) exist, so that the team's response
    is consistent, focused and repeatable.

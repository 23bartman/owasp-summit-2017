## Why

Responding to Security Incidents should not be an improvised or non-scripted activity. It is key that workflows and action-plans
    are created in advance, so that the team's response is consistent, focused and repeatable.

## What

 - Create Security Monitoring Playbooks that can be used by the Community

## Who

 - Security teams
 - SOC teams

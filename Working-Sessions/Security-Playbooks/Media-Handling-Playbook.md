## Why

When (not if) a security incident occurs (from ransomware, to PII information disclosure, to Owasp top 10 exploitation), having a
  clear plan for how to handle the media (and customers) is absolutely critical. This is very related to GDPR notice requirements

Multiple scenarios need to have been previously created with trigger points previously defined.

Customers and regulatory bodies, tend to be quite understanding when the communications about an incident are: quick, accurate and
  technically correct.

## Why

All companies perform 'Pentests' of their most critical applications. Most of the time this is performed in a 'blackbox'
    mode where the security professionals performing the test have no access to the source code of the application, to its developers,
    to its current attacker's profile and to existing Threat Models.

This means that the effectiveness of those 'Pentests' is very reduced, there is very little assurance of quality and
    the customer gets very little value for money.

What we need to do are 'AspSec Reviews' which are much more thorough engagements (where the security professional has
    access to 'everything')

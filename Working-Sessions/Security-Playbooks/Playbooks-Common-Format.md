## Why

To collaborate effectively and agree on a common format for the playbooks, we should clearly define what we want the playbooks to look like, what format to submit the data in, and what the result will be.

This should be based on git/GitHub, and should consider the numerous tools that are currently in use.

It is also important to assess the code/scripts that support the automation of these Playbooks.

The Working Session will explore these issues to prepare for the various Playbook Working Sessions.

## What

 - Review current formats
 - Define common playbook format
 - Create plan for how it will be used on the Playbook Working Sessions

## Who

The target audience for this Working Session is:

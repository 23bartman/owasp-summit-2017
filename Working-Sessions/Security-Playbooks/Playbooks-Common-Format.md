## Why

In order to collaborate effectively we need to have a very clear definition of what the playbooks should look like,
 what format the data should be submitted in, and  what should be the end result.

This should be git/GitHub based, and should take into account the multitude tools that are currently used.

Also important are the code/scripts that support the automation of these Playbooks

## What

 - Review current formats
 - Define common playbook format
 - Create plan for how it will be used on the Playbook Working Sessions


## Who

 - 'Security Playbooks' Track organisers and participants

## Why

Given the scale of the Ransomware market ($209 Million paid in 2016) and the scale of its operations (50% of organizations
    have responded to an Ransomware campaign) and increased used of technology (exploits used to propagate), it is just a matter
    of time, before a security team is tasked with dealing with an Ransomware incident.

When that happens, it is very important that very clean workflows (aka playbooks) exist, so that the that the team's response
    is consistent, focused and repeatable.

Is there a future for privacy?

The target of this session is to illuminate security of personal data from a strategic point of view:
Risks, controls & measures, and future trends.
At the end of this discussion process there could be a set of expert statements concerning now and future 
challenges for improving the security of personal data. 
This set of statements we can use for a public OWASP privacy-campaign.
During OWASP Summit 2011 there was already a session concerning privacy (see(1)) - the widespread results of
this workshop may serve as a basis for this session.

You may say: Privacy is not a principal point in the work of OWASP. But let me counter:
- Privacy is a very important topic for really everyone, it's a topic of information security - so it should be for OWASP too.
- Improving privacy in future will be primarily a software challenge - especially for web applications and IoT. That is OWASP.
- OWASP is well known by experts, but not in the public. I think OWASP should have more weight in public discussion. And a privacy campaign might be a tool to raise public attention.

Questions:
- Personal data risk assessment: Definition and categorization of assets, criticality, vulnerabilities, threat vectors, risks.
  Which work is already done, what has still to be worked out?
- Privacy-"triage": which kinds of data are already "lost", which can still be saved?
- Which technical solutions we will be needed in future - not what is technical possible but what is needed 
  from the viewpoint of individuals?
- Which are the upcoming challenges of web application security for improving privacy / protection of personal data?
- Who are the stakeholders of these technical developments
- Which driving forces can be used for kick-off development processes?


Potential outcomes
- OWASP Privacy statements
- Concept of a campaign and compliance of OWASP community and foundation, road map

Participants:
- everyone who cares about privacy.

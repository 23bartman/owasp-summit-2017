**Threat Modeling General Assembly Daily Meeting** (2 HRS)

Purpose of the GA discussion is to discuss goals of workshops and overarching mission behind the Threat Modeling working sessions for the week.  First day will be a longer session and daily session will simply be an hour before break out sessions begin. Key goals for the week are the following:

- pain of manual processes and how to optimise them
- linking threat models and sub-threat models together
- creating threat model templates for security patterns
- define a taxonomy of terms (to be sent out prior to summit as RFC)
- better threat model diffing
- integration into DevOps
- use of output by downstream systems... development, test, deployment, etc
- making the infrastructure and system (as opposed to just software) threat modeling more mature
- unified input and output in a sSDL
- simplifying threat modeling for business environments
- Scaling threat models throughout an organization (central storage, versioning control, etc)
- Automating threat models


**Threat Modeling Workshop Topics (DRAFT)**

- Build threat modeling templates by app arch type or deployment model
- Build web app threat modeling templates by industry type
- Rework OWASP threat modeling page and create subpages on threat modeling methodologies that exist w/ details and artifacts
-- As SUB-Workshop to refactoring the OWASP TM page, build a complete how to for software centric threat models
-- As SUB-Workshop to refactoring the OWASP TM page, build a complete how to for risk centric threat models
--- Risk rating methods
-- As SUB-Workshop to refactoring the OWASP TM page, build a complete how to for security centric threat models
-- Using TM methodologies in other phases of the sSDL (e.g. as external pentester)
- Build a lightweight threat modeling process with artifacts (e.g. - RACI, DFDs, etc.) for Agile and/or DevOps environments
- For Agile environment, build a "how to" explaining incremental threat modeling, to concentrate on the features required for the current iteration.
- For starting threat modeling on existing project/codebase - how to start without the need to cover everything (a bit similar to introducing tests to legacy software, but  not quite).
- Build a *application component* library to compliment other libraries(attack, threat, weakness, etc) used as part of threat models
- Review current threat (not attack) libraries or categorizations (like STRIDE) and build a threat library that encapsulates threats seen today to leverage in app threat models.
- We need a countermeasure library.  Help build this and define a schema for this.  Leverage other OWASP content ideally (e.g. - cheat sheets, SKF mitigation guidance, etc.)
- Threat Modeling Cheat Sheet 
-- Splitting up threat models integration into domain-agnostic and domain-specific
-- Enabling Security champions to perform domain agnostic threat models
- Define standard reporting schema / common format

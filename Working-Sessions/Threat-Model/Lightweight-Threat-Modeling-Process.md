- Build a lightweight threat modeling process with artifacts (e.g. - RACI, DFDs, etc.) for Agile and/or DevOps environments
- For Agile environment, build a "how to" explaining incremental threat modeling, to concentrate on the features required for the current iteration.
- For starting threat modeling on existing project/codebase - how to start without the need to cover everything (a bit similar to introducing tests to legacy software, but  not quite).
- Build a *application component* library to compliment other libraries(attack, threat, weakness, etc) used as part of threat models
- Review current threat (not attack) libraries or categorizations (like STRIDE) and build a threat library that encapsulates threats seen today to leverage in app threat models.
- We need a countermeasure library.  Help build this and define a schema for this.  Leverage other OWASP content ideally (e.g. - cheat sheets, SKF mitigation guidance, etc.)

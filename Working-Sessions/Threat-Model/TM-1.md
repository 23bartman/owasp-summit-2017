Get together to create models (diagrams) of Juiceshop to help us find problems with it, learn threat modeling, and deliver examples.

## Why

Dinis proposed a set of evening sessions to create threat model artifacts & examples for the JuiceShop vulnerable app.

## What

Create models/diagrams that show various aspects of Juiceshop (model 1: what's the app?  model 2: how does it get deployed?  Model 3? How is it "developed and maintained"?  Other models as seem possibly interesting), and apply various techniques to answer the question "what are we working on?"

## Definition of Done

set of models checked in.  Possibly also sets of requirements or assumptions.
## Who

Participants in the threat modeling track, participants interested in juiceshop, those who want to learn to threat model.

As more companies move towards 'The Cloud', this stream will attempt to give you a framework to work with to properly identify and manage the risks involved.

## Why

'The Cloud' has every chance of being the next Talk Talk or Target (literally). To be able to produce a crib sheet to help negate the potential issues may helpa lot of businesses.

## What

What risks? What threats? Where from? By who? How do they fit together? What is the attack surface? Can it go further?

## Who

CISO, Architects, Project Managers, Product Owners and people interested in it.

"Threat modeling is virtually non existent in IoT." (see this [Twitter threat](https://twitter.com/cybergibbons/status/858746049523052544))

...intro text...

## Why

Structured thinking about what might go wrong is an essential part of engineering more secure products.  It may be that many organizations don't know where to start and a sample threat model could be useful.  It may also be that there are common failure modes and those modes could be addressed with analyses and solutions, in the same way that "salted hashes" are the accepted and worked through way to store passwords.

## What

* Sample threat model for a thing
* Engineering tradeoff discussion documents for common suggestions (eg, "change password on deploy" vs "cloud management")

## Definition of Done

- Sample threat model
- Discussion documents

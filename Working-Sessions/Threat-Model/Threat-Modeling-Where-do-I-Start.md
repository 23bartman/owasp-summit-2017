Single most common question I get from Developers

## Why

In order to run, you need to learn to walk. 
For an organization / group to understand and use Threat Modeling, they need to know where to start.

## What

1. What are some guidelines could we provide to help teams get started?
2. What tools do they need?
3. What people should be involved? 

## Who

... developers
... architects
... security SMEs
... SCRUM masters
... security champions

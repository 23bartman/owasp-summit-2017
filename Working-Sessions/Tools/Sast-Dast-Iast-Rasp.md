Review of SAST, DAST, IAST and RASP tools out there at the moment and how an organisation can cherry pick the best of each to give a cost effective appsec vulnerability management capability that meets their needs.

## Why

There are many tools that can help an oganisation to check vulnerabilities in their software. Each tool has a specific place where it will be applied, and you will hace many findings to analise and track.

## Potential outcomes

 * CheatSheets for tools usage? (can this be done in an agnostic way?)
 * Adding tools in a CI Pipeline effectively? (how/where?)
 * Integration with visualization tools/IDEs?
 * Howto parse and filter results? (recommendations for writing specific tests?)

## Who

* AppSec professionals
* *ST and RASP service providers
* Consulting companies
* Standards bodies

## Why

Holacracy is a very interesting organization model which could work really well on Tracks and even Working Sessions

## What

 - create a model that could be used in the Summit (ideally before the Summit Starts)
 - find Track and Working Sessions organisers that are willing to try this out
 - find companies who have used it and ask them to share their experiences

## Who

 - Working Sessions organisers
 - Companies using Holacracy

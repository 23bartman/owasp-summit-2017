### Introduction

WebGoat is a deliberately insecure web application maintained by OWASP designed to teach web application security lessons. You can install and practice with WebGoat. There are other 'goats' such as WebGoat for .Net. In each lesson, users must demonstrate their understanding of a security issue by exploiting a real vulnerability in the WebGoat application. For example, in one of the lessons the user must use SQL injection to steal fake credit card numbers. The application aims to provide a realistic teaching environment, providing users with hints and code to further explain the lesson.

The main focus of WebGoat 8.0 is on the training aspect which will teach developers not only on how to exploit a vulnerability but also how to fix and mitigate them. 


### Questions / Ideas

1. Add the ability to fix a vulnerability within a lesson. Instead of just finding an issue we want to add the ability for users to try to fix the issue at hand. Technically quite challenging to implement this without restarting the complete WebGoat application.
2. For 1 we need to 'automatically' verify an implemented fix. Basically we need testcases which will try to trigger the issue at hand. It would be nice if we can develop a shared knowledge base in which you can submit your solution and in which others try to
break proposed solutions.
3. Can we share come up with a shared knowlegde base for different Goat implementations? Only the language implementation details are 
different the explanation about a specific vulnerability and mitigation can be shared.
4. Develop more lesson content, for example lessons specifically about crypto.

## Application Security BSc/Masters Curriculum Design

Organizer(s): [Adrian-Winckles](../Participants/Adrian-Winckles.html)

Part of OWASP's main purpose is to _"Be the thriving global community that drives visibility and evolution in the safety and security of the worldâ€™s software"_ and a key part of that mission is to educate not just the current generation of developers or information security professionals but also the next geenration as well especially with the acknowledged skill shortge in the whole sector that exists.

A common problem with many security education education programmes (whether we say cyber or infosec) or even tradiitonal computer science programs is that they do not address application security adequatley or in some cases at all.  In some regions there have been the starting motions of trying to address this deficit.  In the Uk for example ISC2 and the BCS are working on an initiiative to embed security firnly within the Comouter Science curriculum especially scure coding techniques and OWASP (through myself) are slso championing this initative.

There is an opportunity for OWASP to pull together its respected myriad of expertise, projects and dedicated volunteers to engage in these types of education programmes and initiatives by having an educational strategy for undergrad/Postgrad which is an open "Standard" template which can be adopted and adapted by a diversity of educational partners and organisations.  It also gives a useful starting point or refernce docuemn when we can help engage with other professional bodies.

### Questions / Ideas

1. Exploring what aspects of Application Security skills industry needs?
2. Exploring what problems relating to application security need to be solved by the next incoming generation of graduate software developers, computer scientists  and security analysts?
3. Establish a core set of learning objectives for BSC/MSc level Application Security currciulum's
4. Establish which OWASP Projects are useful to help shape and support curriculi in Application Security.
5. Determine a mechanism by which regional/local deliveries of the curriculum could be supported by the OWASP community (I'm thinking OWASP supporters on validation panels, critical friend on module desgn, guest lectures and training academics)

### To invite

- OWASP Project Leaders with projects which have an educational element (which is probably all)
- Application Security Trainers 
- Academic's involved in AppSec and InfoSec (trying to avoid the Cyber word)
- Any employer involved in recruituing graduates into application security related roles
- Other organisations/professioanl bodies with a vested interest in application security educational programmes.

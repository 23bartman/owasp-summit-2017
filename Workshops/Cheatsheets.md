## OWASP Cheatsheets

(add details, why, what, who)

* Bring together Cheatsheets creators and users 
* Workshop ideas:
  * Workshops on improving existing Cheatsheets, debating finer details of their content, and creating new ones
  * Work on an updated version of the CheatSheets book https://www.owasp.org/images/9/9a/OWASP_Cheatsheets_Book.pdf (maybe adding it to Leanpub and Amazon)
* Plan next steps and what should be worked on next (after the Summit)
* Question: What would be a realistic delivereable for the Summit
* Who should attend?

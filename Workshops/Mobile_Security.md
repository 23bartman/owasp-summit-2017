## Mobile Security

### Questions to answer:
* How can requirements from MASVS be integrated into Agile environments?
* What are pain points at the moment in Mobile Security development, when considering/implementing security?
* What are pain points at the moment for Penetration Testers and QA testers when testing mobile Apps?
* How can testing be automated for Penetration Testers and QA Testers, e.g. by utilizing
   * BDD
   * MobSF
* How can mobile developers be trained to code securely?
* How can (Penetration/QA) testers be trained to identify vulnerabilites in weak implemented mobile Apps?


###  Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS)
* Working on MASVS - https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs
* Review MASVS in order to get acceptance from the community


### Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG)
* Working on MSTG - https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg
* Review MSTG in order to agree on a beta version and get acceptance from the community


### Hacking-Playground
* Working on Mobile Hacking Playground, https://github.com/OWASP/OMTG-Hacking-Playground
* Working on curriculum/study material for mobile education purpose in trainings and workshops.
   * Offensive: For penetration testers / security researchers to identify bad practices, dangerous methods and classes they should look at when assessing a Mobile App. Goal is to gain more knowledge through the information provided in the MSTG.
   * Defensive: For developers to identify vulnerable code in the provided Appâ€™s so they can see the implications and risks if such patterns are used and can look for the best practices in the MSTG to mitigate the vulnerabilities.


### To Invite:
* iOS/Android researchers
* Representatives from Android / Apple iOS
* Representatives from Mobile Frameworks (Kony?)

## NextGen Security Scanners

### Problem statement

Today's security scanners were built for yesterday's web applications, based on server-side rendering concepts. They often fail or at least lack functionality when it comes to modern web applications using rich Javascript clients.

### Questions

* What makes scanning Javascript-heavy applications so different?
* What functionality is missing in today's scanner tools?
* How to improve the automation parts of existing tools?
* How to further assist users during proxied manual pentests?
* How can vulnerable applications like [OWASP Juice Shop](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Juice_Shop_Project) be used by scanner vendors as a sample victim?

### Participant candidates

* OWASP ZAP, Arachni and other OSS scanner developers
* Burp, Acunetix and other commercial scanner developers
* Javascript frontend developers
* Web application developers

### Potential outcomes

* OWASP ZAP extensions for Javascript client-side code analysis
* Improvements of OWASP ZAP Ajax Spider
* Additional vulnerabilities for OWASP Juice Shop that showcase vulnerabilities found in the wild

## IAM for REST APIs

### Problem statement

REST APIs are ubiquitous. Since Stege Yegge's rant, every self-respecting platform has worked on exposing its capabilities via REST APIs. Monetization of APIs in the API economy is a present-day gold rush. REST APIs is the favored way to connect micro-services. Yet, solid insights into securing REST APIs are lacking. The OWASP cheat sheet is notably out of date, focusing on issues such as session management that hark back to a past where REST services were merely a data layer for simple web applications. Contemporary REST APIs serve a multitude of consumers covering a wide variety of profiles. The game has changed and we need to rethink the security measures we take to protect the APIs, consumers and end users.

### Questions

* Are there any tried-and-tested implementations of those standards?
* Any common vulnerabilities?
* Implementation/integration guidelines?

### Candidate technologies to try outcomes

* OAuth 2.0
* OpenID Connect
* Hawk
* Oz

### Potential outcomes

* A new version of the REST Security Cheatsheet.
* One or more demonstrators.

### Participants

* back-end REST services developers
* SPA developers
* mobile developers

#### 1. Which nights of accommodation are included in the summit ticket + accommodation - 5 days code? I wanted to know if Sunday night is included so that I can arrive on Sunday.

The 24h-5day tickets cover catering/lodging from Monday morning until Friday evening (exact hours to be verified).
This does not include Sunday night.

#### 2.  I have a non UK VAT number, can you apply the reverse charge VAT mechanism?

OWASP charges UK VAT (value added tax) of 19% on all Tickets, which can be claimed back from your national tax authorities.
Where a General Rule service is supplied from a supplier in one Member State to a customer in another Member State, the invoice
from the supplier is free of VAT and the customer accounts for the VAT due in their Member State by applying the reverse charge.
However, the service that OWASP will provide to you – admission to an event in UK – does not fall within the General Rule, there are
different rules applying.  This is detailed in Article 53 of the VAT Directive (2006/112/EC) which states: “Article 53. The place of
supply of services in respect of admission to cultural, artistic, sporting, scientific, educational, entertainment or similar events,
such as fairs and exhibitions, and of ancillary services related to the admission, supplied to a taxable person, shall be the place where
those events actually take place.“.

The UK VAT that you incur may be recoverable by making a claim under the Refund Directive 2008/9/EC. This involves making a claim directly
to your national tax authorities via their electronic portal.

#### 3. How do I get to the summit

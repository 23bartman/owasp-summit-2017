      framework which users can implement in their own organizations and a "low
      level" penetration testing guide that describes techniques for testing
      most common web application and web service security issues. Nowadays the
      Testing Guide has become the standard to perform a Web Application
      Penetration Testing and many Companies all around the world have adopted
      it. It is vital for the project mantaining an updated project that
      represents the state of the art for WebAppSec.

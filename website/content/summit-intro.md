# The Summit 12123 123

The OWASP Summit 2017 is a participant driven community event, dedicated to the collaboration of Development and Security professionals. 

Unlike other conferences that use uni-directional presentations, at this 5-day event participants will work and collaborate in working sessions to create solutions for the most common security problems faced by the community.
